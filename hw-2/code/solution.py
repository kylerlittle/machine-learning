def logistic_regression(data, label, max_iter, learning_rate):
	'''
	The logistic regression classifier function.

	Args:
	data: train data with shape (1561, 3), which means 1561 samples and 
		  each sample has 3 features.(1, symmetry, average internsity)
	label: train data's label with shape (1561,1). 
		   1 for digit number 1 and -1 for digit number 5.
	max_iter: max iteration numbers
	learning_rate: learning rate for weight update
	
	Returns:
		w: the seperater with shape (3, 1). You must initilize it with w = np.zeros((d,1))

	pass


def thirdorder(data):
	'''
	This function is used for a 3rd order polynomial transform of the data.
	Args:
	data: input data with shape (:, 3) the first dimension represents 
		  total samples (training: 1561; testing: 424) and the 
		  second dimesion represents total features.

	Return:
		result: A numpy array format new data with shape (:,10), which using 
		a 3rd order polynomial transformation to extend the feature numbers 
		from 3 to 10. 
		The first dimension represents total samples (training: 1561; testing: 424) 
		and the second dimesion represents total features.

def accuracy(x, y, w):
    '''
    This function is used to compute accuracy of a logsitic regression model.
    
    Args:
    x: input data with shape (n, d), where n represents total data samples and d represents
        total feature numbers of a certain data sample.
    y: corresponding label of x with shape(n, 1), where n represents total data samples.
    w: the seperator learnt from logistic regression function with shape (d, 1),
        where d represents total feature numbers of a certain data sample.

    Return 
        accuracy: total percents of correctly classified samples. Set the threshold as 0.5,
        which means, if the predicted probability > 0.5, classify as 1; Otherwise, classify as -1.
