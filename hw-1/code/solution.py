#-------------- Implement your code Below -------------#

def show_images(data):
	'''
	This function is used for plot image and save it.

	Args:
	data: Two images from train data with shape (2, 16, 16). The shape represents total 2
	      images and each image has size 16 by 16. 

	Returns:
		Do not return any arguments, just save the images you plot for your report.

def assign_sym_col(label):
        '''
        This function assigns a red color & '*' symbol to labels '+1' (i.e. digit number 1) and a blue color & '+'
        symbol to labels '-1' (i.e. digit number 5).

        Args:
        label: train data's label with shape (1561,1). 
	    1 for digit number 1 and -1 for digit number 5.

def show_features(data, label):
	'''
	This function is used for plot a 2-D scatter plot of the features and save it. 

	Args:
	data: train features with shape (1561, 2). The shape represents total 1561 samples and 
	      each sample has 2 features.
	label: train data's label with shape (1561,1). 
		   1 for digit number 1 and -1 for digit number 5.
	
	Returns:
	Do not return any arguments, just save the 2-D scatter plot of the features you plot for your report.

def perceptron(data, label, max_iter, learning_rate):
	'''
	The perceptron classifier function.

	Args:
	data: train data with shape (1561, 3), which means 1561 samples and 
		  each sample has 3 features.(1, symmetry, average internsity)
	label: train data's label with shape (1561,1). 
		   1 for digit number 1 and -1 for digit number 5.
	max_iter: max iteration numbers
	learning_rate: learning rate for weight update
	
	Returns:
		w: the seperater with shape (1, 3). You must initilize it with w = np.zeros((1,d))
	'''


def show_result(data, label, w):
	'''
	This function is used for plot the test data with the separators and save it.
	
	Args:
	data: test features with shape (424, 2). The shape represents total 424 samples and 
	      each sample has 2 features.
	label: test data's label with shape (424,1). 
		   1 for digit number 1 and -1 for digit number 5.
	
	Returns:
	Do not return any arguments, just save the image you plot for your report.
