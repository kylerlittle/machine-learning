	\section*{Problem \#1}
	Exercise 8.15 (e-Chap:8-38) in LFD.
	
	\section*{Problem \#2}
	Exercise 8.16 (e-Chap:8-42) in LFD. Please ignore part (c) and only do (a), (b), (d).
		
	\section*{Problem \#3}
	(a) Describe what are hinge loss, logistic regression loss, and 0-1 loss mathematically. Describe their similarities and differences using the unified picture we developed in class. \\
	(b) By relying on the result in the above question, consider a point that is correctly classified and distant from the decision boundary. Why would SVMâ€™s decision boundary be unaffected by this point, but the one learned by logistic regression be affected?
	
	\section*{Problem \#4}
	Summarize your observations from the coding portion into a short report. In your report, please report the accuracy result and total support vector number of each model. A briefly analysis based on the results is also needed.
